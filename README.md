## What is this project ?

This **vertx-pac4j-demo** project is a Java web demo to test the [vertx-pac4j library](https://github.com/pac4j/vertx-pac4j) with Facebook, Twitter, form authentication, basic auth, CAS...  
The **vertx-pac4j** library is built to:

- delegate authentication to a provider and be authenticated back in the protected application with a complete user profile retrieved from the provider
- support direct authenticated calls.


## Quick start & test

To build the demo:

    cd vertx-pac4j-demo
    mvn package

You can then run the demo with:

    java -jar target/vertx-pac4j-demo-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT-fat.jar

Browse the demo on *http://localhost:8080*

To test the CAS support, you need to start a CAS server on port 8888. 
Use the following demo: [cas-overlay-demo](https://github.com/leleuj/cas-overlay-demo) with the option: -Djetty.port=8888.
